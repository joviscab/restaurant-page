# Odin Project - Restaurant Page

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Restaurant Page and is part of the Javascript Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the ES6 Modules and Webpack knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Restaurant Webpage, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The idea is to use ES6 Modules and Webpack for the first time to organize my code.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the ES6 Modules and Webpack skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

Thank you for your interest! I'm still here, going deeper in Javascript, this shit is crazy, but still here...
